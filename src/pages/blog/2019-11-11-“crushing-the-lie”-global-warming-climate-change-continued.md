Do you want to help put an end to the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on this country and the world? (Global warming and climate change) Here’s something everyone can do.



When I see a label on or an ad for any product or service promoting global warming, climate change, or any other part of the green movement, I make note NOT to buy that product or service.



Reasons:



   1. They believe in this hoax, thus they are naive.



   2. They do not believe in the hoax, but have decided to make money off of this lie, thus they are corrupt.



I suggest everyone who believes in God, and thus not this hoax, make every effort not to purchase any product or service marketed in such a way.



This may be the only way to stop this movement. Our politicians won’t listen because they see this as a way to grow government, taking away our freedom, our income, and our property, which are all components of liberty, the foundation of this nation.
